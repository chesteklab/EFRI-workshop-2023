Overview: These were instructed delay experiments with text-based movement cues that assessed tuning to attempted orofacial movements, attempted speaking of single words, or isolated phoneme production attempts (either a single consonant plus the "AA" vowel, or vowels by themselves) - these data are featured in Figure 1 of the paper. On each trial, the participant (T12) first saw a red square with text above it that described what movement she should attempt on that trial (see "cueList" for each cue). Then, when the square turned green, T12 attempted the movement. Finally, for the orogacial movements task, each trial ended with a 1 second "return" period where T12 returned to a neutral posture. T12 was seated in a chair facing a computer monitor where the cues were displayed. Data was collected in a series of 'blocks' (2 repetitions of each condition in each block), in between which T12 rested. Neural data between blocks was not recorded. Data can be loaded with MATLAB or Python (scipy.io.loadmat). For t12.2022.04.26_phonemes and t12.2022.05.03_fiftyWordSet, audio data was recorded with a microphone. 

spikePow : T x F matrix of binned spike band power (20 ms bins), where T = number of time steps in the experiment and F = number of channels (256). Spike band power was defined as the mean of the squared voltages observed on the channel after high-pass filtering (250 Hz cutoff; units of microvolts squared). The data was denoised with a linear regression reference technique. The channels correspond to the arrays as follows (where 000 refers to the first column of spikePow and 255 refers to the last):

tx1 : T x F matrix of binned threshold crossing counts (20 ms bins), where T = number of time steps in the experiment and F = number of channels (256). The data was denoised with a linear regression reference technique and a -3.5 x RMS threshold was used. The channels correspond to the arrays in the same way as spikePow described above.

tx2 : Same as tx1 but with a -4.5 x RMS threshold.

tx3 : Same as tx1 but with a -5.5 x RMS threshold.

tx4 : Same as tx1 but with a -6.5 x RMS threshold.

trialState : T x 1 vector of trial state codes (T=number of 20 ms time steps), which describe for each time step what part of the trial the task was in (0=delay period, 1=go period, 2=return period).

blockNum : T x 1 vector of block numbers (T=number of 20 ms time steps), which describe for each time step what block number that time step was recorded during. Note that gaps in the recordings occur when the block number changes (neural activity in between blocks was not recorded).

audioEnvelope: T x 1 vector of estimated audio volume from the microphone (T=number of 20 ms time steps). Can be used to estimate the onset and offset of attempted speech.

audio: B x 1 vector of raw audio snippets (B=number of blocks). Audio data was recorded at 30 kHz and is aligned to the neural data (it begins at the first time step of neural data for that block). 

trialDelayTimes : N x 1 vector of delay period durations (N=number of trials), which describe for each trial the duration of the delay period on that trial (delay periods had random durations).

goTrialEpochs : N x 2 matrix of go period epochs (N=number of trials), where each row describes the starting and ending time step of the go period for that trial (indexing starts at 1, not 0).

delayTrialEpochs : N x 2 matrix of go period epochs (N=number of trials), where each row describes the starting and ending time step of the delay period for that trial. 

trialCues : N x 2 matrix of cue numbers (N=number of trials), where each entry descirbes the movement cue given on that trial. To get the text of that cue, use cueList. For example, to see the cue given on the 5th trial, use MATLAB code "cueList{trialCues(5)}" or Python code "cueList[0,trialCues[5]-1]". For the phonemes experiment, the cues correspond to the ARPABET phonemes in the following order: ['B','CH','NOTHING','D','F','G','HH','JH','K','L','ER','M','N','NG','P','R','S','SH','DH','T','TH', 'V','W','Y','Z','ZH','OY','EH','EY','UH','IY','OW','UW','IH','AA','AW','AY','AH','AO','AE']

cueList : C x 1 vector of cues (C=number of unique cues in the experiment), where each entry contains the text cue corresponding to that movement condition.

xpcClock : T x 1 vector of simulink clock times (T=number of 20 ms time steps), in units of the number of milliseconds since simulink started (starts at 0 at the beginning of each block). 

nsp1Clock : T x 1 vector of clock times for NSP1 (T=number of 20 ms time steps), in units of 30 killosamples. Time 0 is when the NSP began recording. NSP1 recorded channels 1-128.

nsp2Clock : T x 1 vector of clock times for NSP2 (T=number of 20 ms time steps), in units of 30 killosamples. Time 0 is when the NSP began recording. NSP2 recorded channels 129-256.
